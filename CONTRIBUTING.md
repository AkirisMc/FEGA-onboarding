## Requesting changes to FEGA onboarding materials

To request changes to FEGA onboarding materials, follow the steps below:

1. **Gather information** for the requested change. There are two main types of requests: (1) for updates to existing materials and (2) for addition of new materials. To request either type of change, the following pieces of information are required:

    1. The website URL or GitHub repository path of the page where the requested update/new material is to be located
    1. The requested update/new materials, including as much detail as possible
    1. Why the update/new material is being requested, including what the added value is
        
1. **Submit a request** for the change. Anyone can request changes to the onboarding materials by creating a GH issue in this repository using this [GH template](https://github.com/repo/url/issues/new?template=request_change.md). Follow the template to include the information indicated in Step 1. Please add the "requsted-change" label to the issue.

1. **Track progress** of the request. The request will be reviewed by members of the FEGA community. Clarification may be requested. A proposed change will be made (via a GH pull request) to address the request and will be reviewed by the FEGA community. Once the change is accepted, the pull request will be merged and the related issue will be closed.
