# Establishing a Federated EGA Node

**This readme is a placeholder for draft content before we set up the real repository on EGA-archive and organise it to render a useful website, like how the [Galaxy Training Network](https://github.com/galaxyproject/training-material) does it.**

Welcome to this collection of onboarding materials for establishing a Federated EGA Node!

## What am I doing here?

If you are reading this, you are probably looking for information on how to join the Federated EGA Network. Great! There is a lot of information here for you.

These materials provide guidance for establishing a node in the Federated EGA Network. They are based on the knowledge and experiences of current nodes and their use cases. Your node's development might differ depending on your use cases and mandates from stakeholders. Please view these materials as suggestions and best practices - not hard requirements!

## What is Federated EGA?

**The Federated EGA is the primary global resource for discovery and access of sensitive human omics and associated data consented for secondary use, through a network of national human data repositories to accelerate disease research and improve human health.**

Over the last 10 years, most individual-level human omics data have been generated in the context of research consortia and shared via global repositories such as the European Genome-phenome Archive (EGA). Many countries now have emerging personalized medicine programmes which are generating data from national or regional initiatives. Thus, human genomics is undergoing a step change from being a research-driven activity to one funded through healthcare initiatives.

Genetic data generated in a healthcare context is subject to more stringent information governance than research data and often must comply with national legislation. To address this need, the Federated EGA provides a network of connected resources to enable transnational discovery of and access to human data for research while also respecting jurisdictional data protection regulations. By providing a solution to emerging challenges around secure and efficient management of human omics and associated data, the Federated EGA fosters data reuse, enables reproducibility, and accelerates biomedical research.

Summary of Federated EGA node responsiblities:

| Central EGA Node | Federated EGA Node |
| ---------------- | ------------------ |
| Hosts data | Hosts and/or owns data |
| Shares metadata & allows global discovery | Shares metadata to allow global discovery |
| Accepts data from all around the world | Accepts 3rd party data from jurisdiction |
| Has Helpdesk for CEGA data | Has Helpdesk responsible for own data/jurisdiction |
| Chair the Federated EGA Committees | Participates actively in the Federated EGA Committees |
| No time commitment for FEGA | Expected to stay in FEGA for at least 4 years |

## What does the journey look like?

Based on our experience, governance and legal development of a node usually happens in parallel with technical and operational development, followed by development of user-facing components once a node is minimally operating. You may find your path differs slightly for a variety of reasons - that's ok! 

One typical path for becoming a full Federated EGA member:

These materials guide you through onboarding information from the experiences of other nodes. Take what you find useful to apply to your own node development.

There is no time limit on establishing a Federated EGA Node. Onboarding will take more or less time depending on existing infrastructure and governance models, availability of funding and resources, user needs, and other factors.

## Usage

The content of the material is developed collaboratively in shared Google documents and Markdown. A templating system ([Jekyll](http://jekyllrb.com/)) is used to format the onboarding materials and generate a website (**TBD**).

If you want to build the website locally, please have a look at this tutorial (**TBD**).
