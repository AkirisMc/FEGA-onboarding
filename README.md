# Establishing a Federated EGA Node

**This readme is a placeholder for draft content before we set up the real repository on EGA-archive and organise it to render a useful website, like how the [Galaxy Training Network](https://github.com/galaxyproject/training-material) does it.**

Welcome to this collection of onboarding materials for establishing a Federated EGA Node!

## What am I doing here?

If you have made it to this page, you are probably looking for information on how to join the Federated EGA Network. Great! There is a lot of information here for you to look at. 

These onboarding materials are meant to be a general guide for establishing a node within the Federated EGA Network. They are based on knowledge and experiences of current nodes and their individual use cases. Your node's development might be slightly different depending on your own use cases and mandates from stakeholders. Because of this, please view these materials as suggestions and best practices, not hard requirements.

## Where do I start?

- If you are involved in **governance or legal aspects** of establishing a Federated EGA node, you can start [here](#governance-and-legal-aspects-of-establishing-a-node). You might go here if you are a data protection officer, data steward, policy maker, etc.
- If you are involved in **technical or operational aspects** of establishing a Federated EGA node, you can start [here](#technical-and-operational-aspects-of-establishing-a-node). You might go here if you are a software developer, bioinformatician, data steward, support officer, etc.
- If you are involved in **outreach or training aspects** of establishing a Federated EGA node, you can start [here](#outreach-and-training-aspects-of-establishing-a-node). You might go here if you are a data steward, support officer, outreach/communications officer, etc.

## What does the journey look like?

Based on past experiences, governance/legal development of a federated EGA nodes usually happens in parallel with technical/operational development, followed by development of user-facing components once a minimal node is operating. You may find your path differs slightly for a variety of reasons - that's ok! 

The aim of these onboarding materials is to guide you through useful information from the experiences of other nodes, and for you to take what you find useful to apply to your own node development. 

## Where can I go for help?
