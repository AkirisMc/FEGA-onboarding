# Federated EGA Maturity Model

Welcome! If you are involved in any aspect of establishing a Federated EGA node, you are in the right place. The information here covers topics related to the Federated EGA Maturity Model.

#### You might find this page useful if you are:
- involved in governance or legal aspects
- involved in technical or operational aspects
- involved in outreach or training aspects
- involved in data or metadata standards aspects

#### By exploring these materials, you will be able to:
- Understand the areas in which a FEGA node matures
- Evaluate your node implementation against maturity indicators
- Compare requirements against other initiative Maturity Models

## Maturity Model

The Federated EGA Maturity Model is envisioned as a mechanism to drive engagement and disengagement of nodes being part of the Federated EGA. The Maturity Model is divided into different domains and sub-domains with a 5-levels maturation scale. The first two levels are deemed to drive the initial interactions of an organisation willing to join the Federated EGA ecosystem. Levels 3 and 4 aim to establish clear guidelines to reach a fully operational Federated EGA Node. Level 5 is designed to facilitate periodic review of the different indicators as well as to ensure the adoption of the most up-to-date technical and legal specifications.

| Maturity Level | Level Description | Level Goal |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Level 1 | No specific actions taken towards a fully operational FEGA node | To enter FEGA |
| Level 2 | Being aware of the needs and initial actions taken to become a FEGA node | |
| Level 3 | Working to be a minimally operational FEGA node | To reach full operational mode |
| Level 4 | Becoming a fully operational FEGA node | |
| Level 5 | Maintaining a fully operational FEGA node with periodic review of the status | To periodic review |
