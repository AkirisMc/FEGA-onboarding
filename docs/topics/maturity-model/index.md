# Maturity Model

Welcome! If you are involved in any aspect of establishing a Federated EGA node, you are in the right place. The information here covers topics related to the Federated EGA Maturity Model.

**You might find this page useful if you are:**
- involved in governance or legal aspects
- involved in technical or operational aspects
- involved in outreach or training aspects
- involved in data or metadata standards aspects

**By exploring these materials, you will be able to:**
- Understand the areas in which a FEGA node matures
- Evaluate your node implementation against maturity indicators
- Compare requirements against other initiative Maturity Models

## 1. Learn about the FEGA Maturity Model

The Federated EGA Maturity Model is a mechanism to drive engagement and disengagement of nodes being part of the Federated EGA. The Maturity Model is divided into different domains, sub-domains, and maturity indicators. The domains are:
- Governance, Strategy, and Sustainability
- Legal
- Data and Metadata Management
- Technical Infrastructure
- Operations Support
- Communications, Community Building, and Engagement

Each indicator outlines stages of maturity with a 5-level maturation scale:

| Level | Description | Goal |
| --- | --- | --- |
| 1 | No specific actions taken towards a fully operational FEGA node | Drive initial node development |
| 2 | Being aware of the needs and initial actions taken to become a FEGA node | Drive initial node development |
| 3 | Working to establish a minimally operational FEGA node | Reach fully operational node |
| 4 | Becoming a fully operational FEGA node | Reach fully operational node |
| 5 | Maintaining a fully operational FEGA node with periodic review of the status | Ensure alignment with latest specifications |

Explore details of the indicators and levels of the FEGA Maturity Model on a dedicated **[website](https://inab.github.io/fega-mm/)** or on **[GitHub](https://github.com/inab/fega-mm)**.
  
## 2. Evaluate against the FEGA Maturity Model

Perform a self-assessment of your node against the Maturity Model (link TBD).

Explore aggregated results of the [first node self-assessments](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1asFVR4a-luoh7jdQJcp3A2RP0-druX1LaXPk-r7FVsY/edit#slide=id.g121731fd043_2_86) (slides, 8 June 2022).

Hear about first-hand experiences [costing a FEGA node](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1XjPH3sI69Hqcz7fXO1B_ThWYTayien8l/view?usp=sharing) (audio recording, 1 March 2022) and read about [resource considerations for establishing and operating a federated human data node](https://doi.org/10.7490/f1000research.1118967.1) (poster, 1 June 2022).
