# Technical and Operational

Welcome! If you are involved in technical or operational aspects of establishing a Federated EGA node, you are in the right place. The information here covers topics related - but not limited - to: technical infrastructure, testing, software/hardware, SOPs, Helpdesk, and team capacity building.

### You might find this page useful if you are:
- a technical team leader
- responsible for procuring resources 
- a software developer or engineer
- a bioinformatician
- a support officer

### After reading this page, you will be able to: (bloom verb - topic (what) - tech (how))
- Understand guidelines and standards for establishing and operating a node
- Set up your node using the local EGA software stack
- Interact with Central EGA using RabbitMQ
- Evaluate your node implementation
- Plan your node end-to-end demonstrator

## Understand about what you need

### Standards & Guidelines

- List of standards e.g. table of GA4GH standards, ELIXIR standards, others?
- [Node Operations Guidelines](https://ega-archive.org/files/EGA-Node-Operations-v2.pdf)
  - The EGA Federated Node Operations gives an overview of the operational areas which require resources in order to create a federated EGA node. The document is based on more than 10 years experience of establishing and operating the EBI and CRG Central EGA nodes. It provides a breakdown of the operational areas of responsibility into Helpdesk Services, Technical Operations, Software Development, and IT Infrastructure.
