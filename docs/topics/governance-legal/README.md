# Governance and Legal

Welcome! If you are involved in governance or legal aspects of establishing a Federated EGA node, you are in the right place. The information here covers topics related - but not limited - to Federated EGA node governance, strategic planning, sustainability, and legal.

**You might find this page useful if you are:**
- a team or node lead
- a grant writer
- a project manager or coordinator
- a lawyer or legal expert
- a data protection officer (DPO)

**By exploring these materials, you will be able to:**
- Evaluate the roles and responsibilities of your node within the FEGA Network
- Understand the role of Committees within the FEGA Network
- Make use of examples and templates to define your node's governance and legal policies

## Governance

### Vision

**The Federated EGA is the primary global resource for discovery and access of sensitive human omics and associated data consented for secondary use, through a network of national human data repositories to accelerate disease research and improve human health.**

Over the last 10 years, most individual-level human omics data have been generated in the context of research consortia and shared via global repositories such as the European Genome-phenome Archive (EGA). Many countries now have emerging personalized medicine programmes which are generating data from national or regional initiatives. Thus, human genomics is undergoing a step change from being a research-driven activity to one funded through healthcare initiatives.

Genetic data generated in a healthcare context is subject to more stringent information governance than research data and often must comply with national legislation. To address this need, the Federated EGA provides a network of connected resources to enable transnational discovery of and access to human data for research while also respecting jurisdictional data protection regulations. By providing a solution to emerging challenges around secure and efficient management of human omics and associated data, the Federated EGA fosters data reuse, enables reproducibility, and accelerates biomedical research.

### Organisation

Here is described the [Federated EGA Structure and Organization](https://ega-archive.org/files/EGA-Federation-Structure-v1.1.pdf). Federated EGA is broadly organised into two main types of nodes: Central EGA nodes (maintained by EMBL-EBI and CRG) and Federated EGA nodes (maintained at national or regional levels). Read the document linked above to learn more about the roles and responsiblities of each type of node.

Federated EGA is governed by two permanent committees:
- The **Federated EGA Strategic Committee** [(Terms of Reference)](https://ega-archive.org/files/ToR-Federated-EGA-Strategic-Committee-v1.1.pdf) provides direction and strategic planning for the Federated EGA. The Committee receives input from the EGA Strategic Committee and provides feedback for the EGA strategic roadmap.
- The **Federated EGA Operations Committee** [(Terms of Reference)](https://ega-archive.org/files/ToR-Federated-EGA-Operations-Committee-v1.1.pdf) reviews operational performance and coordinates technical implementation roadmaps of the Federated EGA. The Committee receives advice from and provides operational reporting to the Federated EGA Strategic Committee.

Additional **Federated EGA Working Groups** are established, as needed. Working groups can be initiated from either of the Committee.

## Legal

Inclusion in the Federated EGA is codified by signing of the [Federated EGA Collaboration Agreement](TBD) between Central EGA (represented by the European Molecular Biology Laboratory and Fundació Centre De Regulació Genòmica) and the Federated EGA node.

## Documents


- [Federated EGA Strategic Committee Terms of Reference (v1.1)](https://ega-archive.org/files/ToR-Federated-EGA-Strategic-Committee-v1.1.pdf) - In the EGA Federation Strategic Committee terms of reference document we describe the purpose and objectives of the committee, which is to provide direction and strategic planning for the federated EGA project. The committee receives input from the EGA Strategic Committee and provides feedback for the EGA strategic roadmap.
- [Federated EGA Operations Committee Terms of Reference (v1.1)](https://ega-archive.org/files/ToR-Federated-EGA-Operations-Committee-v1.1.pdf) - The EGA Federation Operations Committee terms of reference describes the purpose and objectives of the operations committee, which is to review operational performance and coordinate technical implementation roadmaps of EGA Federated and Community nodes. The committee receives advice from the EGA Federated Strategic Committee, and provides operational reporting to the EGA Federated Strategic Committee
- [FEGA Node Operations guidelines (v2.0)](https://ega-archive.org/files/EGA-Node-Operations-v2.pdf) - The EGA Federated Node Operations gives an overview of the operational areas which require resources in order to create a federated EGA node. The document is based on more than 10 years experience of establishing and operating the EBI and CRG Central EGA nodes. It provides a breakdown of the operational areas of responsibility into Helpdesk Services, Technical Operations, Software Development, and IT Infrastructure.
