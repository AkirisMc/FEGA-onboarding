## Federated EGA Vision Statement

The Federated EGA is the primary global resource for discovery and access of sensitive human omics and associated data consented for secondary use, through a network of national human data repositories to accelerate disease research and improve human health.

Over the last 10 years, most individual-level human omics data have been generated in the context of research consortia and shared via global repositories such as the European Genome-phenome Archive (EGA). Many countries now have emerging personalized medicine programmes which are generating data from national or regional initiatives. Thus, human genomics is undergoing a step change from being a research-driven activity to one funded through healthcare initiatives.

Genetic data generated in a healthcare context is subject to more stringent information governance than research data and often must comply with national legislation. To address this need, the Federated EGA provides a network of connected resources to enable transnational discovery of and access to human data for research while also respecting jurisdictional data protection regulations. By providing a solution to emerging challenges around secure and efficient management of human omics and associated data, the Federated EGA fosters data reuse, enables reproducibility, and accelerates biomedical research.

## Documents

- [EGA Federation: Structure and Organization (v1.1)](https://ega-archive.org/files/EGA-Federation-Structure-v1.1.pdf) - The structure of an EGA federated network and service expectations. We organise the EGA into three types of nodes: Central EGA, Federated EGA nodes and EGA Community nodes; we outline the goals of such an organization, and summarize the commitments and services provided by the nodes.
- [Federated EGA Strategic Committee Terms of Reference (v1.1)](https://ega-archive.org/files/ToR-Federated-EGA-Strategic-Committee-v1.1.pdf) - In the EGA Federation Strategic Committee terms of reference document we describe the purpose and objectives of the committee, which is to provide direction and strategic planning for the federated EGA project. The committee receives input from the EGA Strategic Committee and provides feedback for the EGA strategic roadmap.
- [Federated EGA Operations Committee Terms of Reference (v1.1)](https://ega-archive.org/files/ToR-Federated-EGA-Operations-Committee-v1.1.pdf) - The EGA Federation Operations Committee terms of reference describes the purpose and objectives of the operations committee, which is to review operational performance and coordinate technical implementation roadmaps of EGA Federated and Community nodes. The committee receives advice from the EGA Federated Strategic Committee, and provides operational reporting to the EGA Federated Strategic Committee
- [FEGA Node Operations guidelines (v2.0)](https://ega-archive.org/files/EGA-Node-Operations-v2.pdf) - The EGA Federated Node Operations gives an overview of the operational areas which require resources in order to create a federated EGA node. The document is based on more than 10 years experience of establishing and operating the EBI and CRG Central EGA nodes. It provides a breakdown of the operational areas of responsibility into Helpdesk Services, Technical Operations, Software Development, and IT Infrastructure.
