## Data security

### Best practices

Central EGA has a [Security Strategy](https://ega-archive.org/files/European_Genome_phenome_Archive_Security_Overview.pdf) which defines best practices in ensuring data are stored securely. The EGA contributes and helps develop the recommendations outlined the GA4GH Security Technology Infrastructure document, which defines guidelines, best practices, and standards for building and operating an infrastructure that promotes responsible data sharing in accordance with the GA4GH Privacy and Security Policy .
