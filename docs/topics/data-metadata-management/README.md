# Data and Metadata Management

Welcome! If you are involved in data or metadata standards aspects of establishing a Federated EGA node, you are in the right place. The information here covers topics related - but not limited - to best practices for data security, data access management, (meta)data standards, and data flow.

#### You might find this page useful if you are:
- a bioinformatician
- a data steward
- a data protection officer
- a support officer

#### By exploring these materials, you will be able to:
- Define data security and access management best practices
- Understand the FEGA metadata schema and how the objects are linked to each other
- Identify data models specific to a diseases (e.g. COVID-19 data model) and apply them when needed
- Comprehend the (meta)data flow within the FEGA Network

## Data security

### Best practices

Central EGA has a [Security Strategy](https://ega-archive.org/files/European_Genome_phenome_Archive_Security_Overview.pdf) which defines best practices in ensuring data are stored securely. The EGA contributes and helps develop the recommendations outlined the GA4GH Security Technology Infrastructure document, which defines guidelines, best practices, and standards for building and operating an infrastructure that promotes responsible data sharing in accordance with the GA4GH Privacy and Security Policy .

Other topics
- Breach response protocol
- Risk register/assessment

### Access management

- DACs - describe what they are
- DUO

## Standards

Largely adhere to [GA4GH standards](https://ega-archive.org/ga4gh). More details below.

### Data/file standards

- File formats - GA4GH
- File formats - not GA4GH
- Encryption (e.g. Crypt4GH)
- Pheno-clinical data as Phenopackets

### Metadata standards

- EGA metadata model/schema
- Ontologies
- Community-specific standards
  - [ELIXIR-CONVERGE D7.3 COVID-19 metadata mapping model across COVID-19 studies in federated EGA](https://zenodo.org/record/4893222) (report, 2 June 2021)
  - COVID-19 HGI
  - Others, e.g. infectious disease, cancer, rare disease

### Quality control
